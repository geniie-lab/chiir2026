# Welcome

This half-day tutorial presents systematic methods for analysing model search behaviour in retrieval-augmented applications. Using an open experimental framework, participants will design and conduct controlled experiments to examine how generative models perform core search actions such as query formulation, document selection, relevance judgement, and query reformulation. The session addresses the growing diversity of generative models and their role in search, emphasising rigorous experimental design, reproducibility, and behavioural interpretation.
